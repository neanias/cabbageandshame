# Madvillain - Madvillainy

I don't listen to much hip-hop currently, but I listened to it a lot as a
teenager. My close school friend, CJ, (whom I'm no longer in contact with 😢)
was mad about hip-hop and got me into it. We mainly listened to 2 artists
called Wax & Dumbfoundead, but I can't say I listen to them that much these
days either.

As I got more and more into hip-hop, especially underground stuff, I invariably
ended up listening to MF DOOM (_remember all caps when you spell the man
name_). MF DOOM collaborated with Madlib for this release and produced an all
time record. In the same year, MF DOOM made _Mm..Food_ which is a similarly
exceptional LP; there's some contention in the 'heads circles as to which of
the two releases is better, but this is the one that remains close to my heart.
The deeply layered rhymes and lyricism of DOOM's bars with the off-kilter beats
from Madlib is it for me.
