# The Cool Greenhouse - The Cool Greenhouse

My favourite band. There's just something about the wry lyricism and janky,
simplistic guitars that really scratches an itch for me. I can't describe it in
any other way. At some point under lockdown (I think I was still living alone?)
I spent the entire evening sitting on my massive bed reading articles about The
Cool Greenhouse, mainly by [the
Quietus](https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/cool-greenhouse-crap-cardboard-pet-ep-album-review/),
and giggling along to their lyrics. As you may remember, a lot of the Cababge &
Shame episode devoted to _The Cool Greenhouse_ was Nathan and I just reading out
the lyrics and laughing. It was a particularly bright memory in an otherwise
gloomy time of my life.

Once the album finally came out, I listened to it over and over through the
summer, particularly in August. _Dirty Glasses_ is probably my favourite track
off this LP. I know the "dirty glasses" refer to the morals of the noted
politicos in the song, but I prefer the idea of them actually being actual dirty
glasses as it makes the imagery a lot funnier.

After we recorded the episode and tagged the band on Instagram, Tom Greenhouse
replied to us about it and said they were also big fans of Yard Act and hoped to
do something with them. Alas, I think Yard Act have rather outgrown such
possibilities.
