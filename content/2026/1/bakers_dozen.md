I get by with a little help from ~~my friends~~
[Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/SuperTweedie/library/albums).

This isn't a list of my favourite 13 records, I must clarify, but is more like
13 records that are particularly memorable for me. They're favourites of mine,
but not necessarily my favourite by a specific artist/band. I'll explain why
they're meaningful in the write-ups. The albums are largely in chronological
order for me.

Oddly, perhaps, neither of the eponymous bands for _the podcast_ made it in.
Their albums certainly inspired and spurred both Nathan and I on in terms of our
musical discoveries, but none of them have lodged as firmly in me as these
releases.

Let's go to [the first album]({filename}bakers_dozen_1.md).
