# IDLES - Joy as an Act of Resistance

This is where we transition out of school days and into university days. IDLES
get a bit of a bad rap for ...many reasons, but this and _Brutalism_ were
seminal albums for me. IDLES topped my listening charts for 2 consecutive years
and were my stepping stone from the indie rock I'd been otherwise bumping to the
deeper interest in post-punk and related scenes. Both _Joy_ and _the next album
in the list_ having been released is still something quite big to me and I'd
struggle to say which was more impactful on me at the time, even if I could tell
you now which I think the better album is. Nathan and I wore this tape out when
we first started listening to them and I still really love this LP, even if I
never really got into IDLES's subsequent releases. The less said about Ultra
Mono, the better.
