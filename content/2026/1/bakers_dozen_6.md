# IDLES - Joy as an Act of Resistance

IDLES get a bit of a bad rap for ...many reasons, but this and _Brutalism_ were
seminal albums for me. This was my stepping stone from the indie rock I'd been
otherwise bumping to the deeper interest in post-punk and related scenes. Both
_Joy_ and _**the next album in the list**_ having been released in the same
year is still something quite big to me and I'd struggle to say which was more
impactful on me at the time, even if I could tell you now which I think the
better album is.

This is where we transition out of school days and into university days. Nathan
and I wore this tape out when we first started listening to them; IDLES topped
my listening charts for 2 consecutive years.
