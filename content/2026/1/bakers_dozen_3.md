# Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon

I have had a prog phase; I know a lot music nerds who have. It feels like a
certain rite of passage in a way. As a teenager (around 14-15) I was trying to
find music to listen to of my own doing rather than in the car and looked
through Dad’s quite serious collection of CDs. They were largely classical, but
I remember finding this, _Shine on Crazy Diamond_ and (the lesser known) _Atom
Heart Mother_. Roger and I both got really into this album and I listened to
Pink Floyd almost non-stop for about 2 months, obsessing over all the
studio-as-an-instrument detail and ignoring my parent’s suggestion to listen to
Emerson, Lake and Palmer (I had street cred, obviously). I have a clear memory
of trying to convince my sister of their brilliance by pointing out their use
of panning the audio from the left channel into the right channel and then out
of both ears. She just said that she’d heard other music do that too. The copy
of this that I have in my music library is probably the same from when I ripped
this CD in the kitchen in Suffolk some 15 years ago. It living on in a new iPod
is a particularly fond thought.
