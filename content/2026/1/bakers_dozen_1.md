# The Beatles - 1

This isn't just a cheap joke that I've put 1 as the first album. But I do enjoy
it nonetheless. Anyway, I have a very clear early memory of seeing this CD being
passed into where I was sitting in the back of the car. I hold a similar memory
with Queen's Greatest Hits. I'm not sure why my parents bought these specific
CDs, but they're now seared into my memory. The funny thing about this
compilation, I find, is that a not insignificant of The Beatles' number 1 hits
were non-album singles — Paperback Writer being a notable one for me.
