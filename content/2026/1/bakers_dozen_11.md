# Sorry - 925

This is the album that dislodged IDLES from my top spot in 2020. In fact, my
year end top 10 albums didn't have any IDLES albums. The change in my top albums
from 2019 to 2020 is quite pronounced, with _925_, _Every Bad_ and _West of
Eden_ by HMLTD taking top billing. _Wide Awake!_ was still in there at no.5,
naturally. Of the big 2019-2020 music shake up, Sorry embedded deepest into my
psyche as evidenced by the ~20 times I listened to it (digitally) that year.
Seeing Sorry play Sneaky Pete's shortly before (9th Feb) they released (27th
Mar) their debut album definitely helped cement that. ([That show later received
a 3/5 rating in The Skinny saying the crowd were too
sedate.](https://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/live-music/reviews/sorry-sneaky-petes-edinburgh-9-feb))

As lockdown bit harder and harder, I was most drawn to gloomy, guitar-driven
stuff, like _925_ and _Every Bad_. What a surprise. Only after I read _the book_
did I start to really shake it up and add a lot more biting late '70s and early
'80s post-punk. Similarly, the good weather cheered me up into albums like _Twin
Heavy_ by Willie J Healey and _Making a New World_ by Field Music. Both 2 albums
I really enjoy but don't make the Baker's Dozen cut.
