# Parquet Courts - Wide Awake!

Parquet Courts should be called _the_ band of their era. The fact that they
started out as a country band before moving to become a post-punk band in
_&lt;Matt Berry voice>New York City&lt;/Matt Berry voice>_ is still wild to me.
This album is all killer, no filler. The slow twisting and turning from the hard
& fast opening of Total Football (**_AND FUCK TOM BRADY!_**), through the
unfettered anger of the delivery of Violence and the swan-song, murder ballad of
Death Will Bring Change. There's a certain requiem in Tenderness as a closing
number, but Nathan and I will continue to disagree about how albums should be
closed.

The lyrical content of Violence being largely Foucauldian in nature was a point
of recurring discussion in the flat because Nathan had been writing his
dissertation on surveillance being a form of state domestic terrorism. Also, we
were wankers.

This album never wilts and is, I would argue, our generation's _Entertainment!_.
I may have found _Joy_ to have spurned me into new music, but _Wide Awake!_ is
the real all-time great album.
