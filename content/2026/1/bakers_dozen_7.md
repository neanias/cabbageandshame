# Parquet Courts - Wide Awake!

Parquet Courts should be called _the_ band of their era. The lore that they
started out as a country band before moving to become a post-punk band in
_&lt;Matt Berry voice>New York City&lt;/Matt Berry voice>_ makes no sense, but
there's a certain Texas country vibe that still lurks under the surface of this
album and that really does make sense.

This album is all killer, no filler. The slow twisting and turning from the hard
& fast opening of Total Football (**_AND FUCK TOM BRADY!_**), through the
unfettered anger of the delivery of Violence and the swan-song, murder ballad of
Death Will Bring Change. There's a certain requiem in Tenderness as a closing
number, but Nathan and I will continue to disagree about how albums should be
closed.

The lyrical content of Violence being largely Foucauldian in nature was a point
of recurring discussion in the flat because Nathan had been writing his
dissertation on surveillance being a form of state domestic terrorism. Also, we
were wankers.

This album never wilts and is, I would argue, our generation's _Entertainment!_.
I may have found _Joy_ to have spurned me into new music, but _Wide Awake!_ is
the real all-time great album.

video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M5yqvvkjEk) where one of Anthony
Fantano's alter-egos interviews them and A. Savage calls him out._
