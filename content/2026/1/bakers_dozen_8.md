# Squid - Houseplants

I appreciate that this is a single and an unusual entry in this list.
Houseplants by Squid is the most important single in my personal musical
journey. Nathan, Jon, Jake Hoyer-Miller and I all bought tickets to go to a day
of All Points East in 2019, mainly because IDLES & Run the Jewels were playing
that day — realistically, Nathan and I said "we have to go to this" and cajoled
the others into it. Nathan and I got to my family home in Suffolk before the
others by some hours for train ticket price reasons and started looking through
the line-up to work out who else we wanted to see _besides_ IDLES & RTJ. We
listened to a few singles for each band and rated them out of 10. As soon as we
heard Houseplants by Squid, we were in love. We were obsessed. I've found the
bullet point in my notes app from 30th May 2019: _"Squid - totally weird, totally
great; houseplants/10."_

The reason _why_ this is the most important single in my personal musical
journey is because **this** specific single is what got Nathan and I deep into
the then-nascent post-punk scene in the UK. The number of small gigs we went to
after that shot up, the number of monthly listeners of our main bands collapsed
(rocking the <1k bands) and the active trajectory of what I was listening to
changed, totally. From Squid, I got into Dry Cleaning, Sorry, Shame, Fontaines
D.C. and Lord only knows how many others. Houseplants was my gateway drug and I
will never quit such an addiction.
