# David Bowie - Hunky Dory

I would have picked this regardless of the 10th anniversary series on 6Music as
it was my favourite Bowie album for a long time. I think it’s probably since
been toppled by Station to Station, Low or perhaps Scary Monsters. As many of
the presenters and guests talked about, this is the album from Bowie’s back
catalogue. His innovations and growth in song writing just before he became
wildly well-known and famous through Ziggy Stardust. I listened to this album
particularly in my gap year (again, street cred) as I was leaving my prog rock
phase and listening to other music. Bowie does, of course, sit in a similar
bracket, but this is where I started to branch out, along with King Krule’s
first album (and King Crimson, but that’s by the bye). I couldn’t quite get
into Ziggy as much as I could Hunky Dory. I found something about the
experimentation of Hunky Dory much more exciting — it being a bit all over the
shop made it much more exciting to me. Also, it’s got some of Bowie’s best
songs on. I can hardly say more than Brett Anderson has already said.
