# The Slits - Cut

Again, what more can I write? Reading Viv Albertine's memoires about this time
gave me a much greater insight into its creation and the band's ...purpose(?)
which was enriching, certainly. The _infamous_ vinyl mix-up incident will never
not be funny to me, but also very joyful that you knew _exactly_ which album I
would want and love.
