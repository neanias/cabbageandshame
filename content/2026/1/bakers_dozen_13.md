# Sparks - No. 1 In Heaven

Would this list be complete without a Sparks album? No. Is this my 100%
favourite Sparks album? Also no. Do I have just 1 favourite Sparks album? _The
answer may shock you:_ still no. The reason this is my Sparks album (_close rep
of "Sparks album"_) of choice here is the overwhelming flush of emotion I had
when I opened my Christmas present from you in 2023 to find it. It was only the
second time I remember where I had a real sense of astonishment when I opened
up a present. A feeling of _"this is absolutely what I want and I had never
thought of it"_. The warmth of being known at one's very core in an almost
visceral way. I was actually stunned to the point of having no words — an
unusual position for me.

I love this album as is, but to have had such a potent experience when given
the LP itself will elevate it into a higher personal pantheon that _Angst In My
Pants_, _Kimono My House_ or _FFS_ could never reach.
