I thought I'd put all of the albums and write-ups in one place for easy consumption.

## Preamble

I get by with a little help from ~~my friends~~
[Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/SuperTweedie/library/albums).

This isn't a list of my favourite 13 records, I must clarify, but is more like
13 records that are particularly memorable for me. They're favourites of mine,
but not necessarily my favourite by a specific artist/band. I'll explain why
they're meaningful in the write-ups. The albums are largely in chronological
order for me.

## The Beatles - 1

This isn't just a cheap joke that I've put 1 as the first album. But I do enjoy
it nonetheless. Anyway, I have a very clear early memory of seeing this CD being
passed into where I was sitting in the back of the car. I hold a similar memory
with Queen's Greatest Hits. I'm not sure why my parents bought these specific
CDs, but they're now seared into my memory. The funny thing about this
compilation, I find, is that a not insignificant of The Beatles' number 1 hits
were non-album singles — Paperback Writer being a notable one for me.

## ELO - Out of the Blue

Wall-to-wall bangers. Mum bought a copy of this CD for the car along with the
Alan Parsons Project and one more that I can no longer remember. Maybe
_Breakfast in America_ by Supertramp. This album is nothing short of lush
romanticism: the strings, the bombast, the silly '70s English dreaming of
greater excitements than Birmingham (like being a cowboy). Jeff Lynne inherits
a lot of his string composition from the Beatles and was also, famously, a
member of the Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison. _Mr Blue Sky_ was
written in Switzerland, in fact. I would say this is ELO's best album and I can
always return to it and be instantly put in a good mood.

## Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon

I have had a prog phase; I know a lot music nerds who have. It feels like a
certain rite of passage in a way. As a teenager (around 14-15) I was trying to
find music to listen to of my own doing rather than in the car and looked
through Dad’s quite serious collection of CDs. They were largely classical, but
I remember finding this, _Shine on Crazy Diamond_ and (the lesser known) _Atom
Heart Mother_. Roger and I both got really into this album and I listened to
Pink Floyd almost non-stop for about 2 months, obsessing over all the
studio-as-an-instrument detail and ignoring my parent’s suggestion to listen to
Emerson, Lake and Palmer (I had street cred, obviously). I have a clear memory
of trying to convince my sister of their brilliance by pointing out their use
of panning the audio from the left channel into the right channel and then out
of both ears. She just said that she’d heard other music do that too. The copy
of this that I have in my music library is probably the same from when I ripped
this CD in the kitchen in Suffolk some 15 years ago. It living on in a new iPod
is a particularly fond thought.

## David Bowie - Hunky Dory

I would have picked this regardless of the 10th anniversary series on 6Music as
it was my favourite Bowie album for a long time. I think it’s probably since
been toppled by Station to Station, Low or perhaps Scary Monsters. As many of
the presenters and guests talked about, this is the album from Bowie’s back
catalogue. His innovations and growth in song writing just before he became
wildly well-known and famous through Ziggy Stardust. I listened to this album
particularly in my gap year (again, street cred) as I was leaving my prog rock
phase and listening to other music. Bowie does, of course, sit in a similar
bracket, but this is where I started to branch out, along with King Krule’s
first album (and King Crimson, but that’s by the bye). I couldn’t quite get
into Ziggy as much as I could Hunky Dory. I found something about the
experimentation of Hunky Dory much more exciting — it being a bit all over the
shop made it much more exciting to me. Also, it’s got some of Bowie’s best
songs on. I can hardly say more than Brett Anderson has already said.

## Madvillain - Madvillainy

I don't listen to much hip-hop currently, but I listened to it a lot as a
teenager. My close school friend, CJ, (who I'm no longer in contact with 😢) was
mad about hip-hop and got me into it. We mainly listened to 2 artists called Wax
& Dumbfoundead, but I can't say I listen to them that much these days either. As
I got more and more into hip-hop, especially underground stuff, I invariably
ended up listening to MF DOOM (_remember all caps when you spell the man name_).
MF DOOM collaborated with Madlib for this release and produced an all time
record. In the same year, MF DOOM made _Mm..Food_ which is a similarly
exceptional LP; there's some contention in the 'heads circles as to which of the
two releases is better, but this is the one that remains close to my heart. The
deeply layered rhymes and lyricism of DOOM's bars with the off-kilter beats from
Madlib is it for me.

## IDLES - Joy as an Act of Resistance

This is where we transition out of school days and into university days. IDLES
get a bit of a bad rap for ...many reasons, but this and _Brutalism_ were
seminal albums for me. IDLES topped my listening charts for 2 consecutive years
and were my stepping stone from the indie rock I'd been otherwise bumping to the
deeper interest in post-punk and related scenes. Both _Joy_ and _the next album
in the list_ having been released is still something quite big to me and I'd
struggle to say which was more impactful on me at the time, even if I could tell
you now which I think the better album is. Nathan and I wore this tape out when
we first started listening to them and I still really love this LP, even if I
never really got into IDLES's subsequent releases. The less said about Ultra
Mono, the better.

## Parquet Courts - Wide Awake!

Parquet Courts should be called _the_ band of their era. The fact that they
started out as a country band before moving to become a post-punk band in
_&lt;Matt Berry voice>New York City&lt;/Matt Berry voice>_ is still wild to me.
This album is all killer, no filler. The slow twisting and turning from the hard
& fast opening of Total Football (**_AND FUCK TOM BRADY!_**), through the
unfettered anger of the delivery of Violence and the swan-song, murder ballad of
Death Will Bring Change. There's a certain requiem in Tenderness as a closing
number, but Nathan and I will continue to disagree about how albums should be
closed.

The lyrical content of Violence being largely Foucauldian in nature was a point
of recurring discussion in the flat because Nathan had been writing his
dissertation on surveillance being a form of state domestic terrorism. Also, we
were wankers.

This album never wilts and is, I would argue, our generation's _Entertainment!_.
I may have found _Joy_ to have spurned me into new music, but _Wide Awake!_ is
the real all-time great album.

## Squid - Houseplants

I appreciate that this is a single and an unusual entry in this list.
Houseplants by Squid is the most important single in my personal musical
journey. Nathan, Jon, Jake Hoyer-Miller and I all bought tickets to go to a day
of All Points East in 2019, mainly because IDLES & Run the Jewels were playing
that day — realistically, Nathan and I said "we have to go to this" and cajoled
the others into it. Nathan and I got to my family home in Suffolk before the
others by some hours for train ticket price reasons and started looking through
the line-up to work out who else we wanted to see _besides_ IDLES & RTJ. We
listened to a few singles for each band and rated them out of 10. As soon as we
heard Houseplants by Squid, we were in love. We were obsessed. I've found the
bullet point in my notes app from 30th May 2019: _"Squid - totally weird, totally
great; houseplants/10."_

The reason _why_ this is the most important single in my personal musical
journey is because **this** specific single is what got Nathan and I deep into
the then-nascent post-punk scene in the UK. The number of small gigs we went to
after that shot up, the number of monthly listeners of our main bands collapsed
(rocking the <1k bands) and the active trajectory of what I was listening to
changed, totally. From Squid, I got into Dry Cleaning, Sorry, Shame, Fontaines
D.C. and Lord only knows how many others. Houseplants was my gateway drug and I
will never quit such an addiction.

## Gang of Four - Entertainment!

I can't remember if I started listening to this album before or after I read
_the book_, but I'm pretty sure it was after. (Having checked Last.FM, it was
definitely after). I don't know how much more I can write about this album than
has already been written. It's a tour-de-force, it's vital, it's ever-relevant.
It's all true and I'm not saying anything new.

## The Slits - Cut

Again, what more can I write? Reading Viv Albertine's memoires about this time
gave me a much greater insight into its creation and the band's ...purpose(?)
which was enriching, certainly. The _infamous_ vinyl mix-up incident will never
not be funny to me, but also very joyful that you knew _exactly_ which album I
would want and love.

## Sorry - 925

This is the album that dislodged IDLES from my top spot in 2020. In fact, my
year end top 10 albums didn't have any IDLES albums. The change in my top albums
from 2019 to 2020 is quite pronounced, with _925_, _Every Bad_ and _West of
Eden_ by HMLTD taking top billing. _Wide Awake!_ was still in there at no.5,
naturally. Of the big 2019-2020 music shake up, Sorry embedded deepest into my
psyche as evidenced by the ~20 times I listened to it (digitally) that year.
Seeing Sorry play Sneaky Pete's shortly before (9th Feb) they released (27th
Mar) their debut album definitely helped cement that. ([That show later received
a 3/5 rating in The Skinny saying the crowd were too
sedate.](https://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/live-music/reviews/sorry-sneaky-petes-edinburgh-9-feb))

As lockdown bit harder and harder, I was most drawn to gloomy, guitar-driven
stuff, like _925_ and _Every Bad_. What a surprise. Only after I read _the book_
did I start to really shake it up and add a lot more biting late '70s and early
'80s post-punk. Similarly, the good weather cheered me up into albums like _Twin
Heavy_ by Willie J Healey and _Making a New World_ by Field Music. Both 2 albums
I really enjoy but don't make the Baker's Dozen cut.

## The Cool Greenhouse - The Cool Greenhouse

My favourite band. There's just something about the wry lyricism and janky,
simplistic guitars that really scratches an itch for me. I can't describe it in
any other way. At some point under lockdown (I think I was still living alone?)
I spent the entire evening sitting on my massive bed reading articles about The
Cool Greenhouse, mainly by [the
Quietus](https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/cool-greenhouse-crap-cardboard-pet-ep-album-review/),
and giggling along to their lyrics. As you may remember, a lot of the Cababge &
Shame episode devoted to _The Cool Greenhouse_ was Nathan and I just reading out
the lyrics and laughing. It was a particularly bright memory in an otherwise
gloomy time of my life.

Once the album finally came out, I listened to it over and over through the
summer, particularly in August. _Dirty Glasses_ is probably my favourite track
off this LP. I know the "dirty glasses" refer to the morals of the noted
politicos in the song, but I prefer the idea of them actually being actual dirty
glasses as it makes the imagery a lot funnier.

After we recorded the episode and tagged the band on Instagram, Tom Greenhouse
replied to us about it and said they were also big fans of Yard Act and hoped to
do something with them. Alas, I think Yard Act have rather outgrown such
possibilities.

## [Sparks - No. 1 In Heaven]({filename}bakers_dozen_13.md)

![Sparks - No. 1 In
Heaven](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/No_1_in_Heaven_-_Sparks.jpg)

Would this list be complete without a Sparks album? No. Is this my 100%
favourite Sparks album? Also no. Do I have just 1 favourite Sparks album? _The
answer may shock you:_ still no. The reason this is my Sparks album (Close rep
of Sparks album) of choice here is the overwhelming flush of emotion I had when
I opened my Christmas present from you in 2023 to find it. It was only the
second time I remember where I had a real sense of astonishment when I opened
up a present. A feeling of "this is absolutely what I want and I had never
thought of it". The warmth of being known at one’s very core in an almost
visceral way. I was actually stunned to the point of having no words — an
unusual position for me.

I love this album as is, but to have had such a potent experience when given
the LP itself will elevate it into a higher personal pantheon that Angst In My
Pants, Kimono My House or FFS could never reach.
