I thought I'd put all of the albums and write-ups in one place for easy consumption.

## Preamble

I get by with a little help from ~~my friends~~
[Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/SuperTweedie/library/albums).

This isn't a list of my favourite 13 records, I must clarify, but is more like
13 records that are particularly memorable for me. They're favourites of mine,
but not necessarily my favourite by a specific artist/band. I'll explain why
they're meaningful in the write-ups. The albums are largely in chronological
order for me.

## The Beatles - 1

## [Sparks - No. 1 In Heaven]({filename}bakers_dozen_13.md)

Would this list be complete without a Sparks album? No. Is this my 100%
favourite Sparks album? Also no. Do I have just 1 favourite Sparks album? _The
answer may shock you:_ still no. The reason this is my Sparks album (Close rep
of Sparks album) of choice here is the overwhelming flush of emotion I had when
I opened my Christmas present from you in 2023 to find it. It was only the
second time I remember where I had a real sense of astonishment when I opened
up a present. A feeling of "this is absolutely what I want and I had never
thought of it". The warmth of being known at one’s very core in an almost
visceral way. I was actually stunned to the point of having no words — an
unusual position for me.

I love this album as is, but to have had such a potent experience when given
the LP itself will elevate it into a higher personal pantheon that Angst In My
Pants, Kimono My House or FFS could never reach.
