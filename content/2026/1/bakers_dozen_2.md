# Electric Light Orchestra - Out of the Blue

Wall-to-wall bangers. Mum bought a copy of this CD for the car along with the
Alan Parsons Project and one more that I can no longer remember. Maybe
_Breakfast in America_ by Supertramp. This album is nothing short of lush
romanticism: the strings, the bombast, the silly '70s English dreaming of
greater excitements than Birmingham (like being a cowboy). Jeff Lynne inherits
a lot of his string composition from the Beatles and was also, famously, a
member of the Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison. _Mr Blue Sky_ was
written in Switzerland, in fact. I would say this is ELO's best album and I can
always return to it and be instantly put in a good mood.
