Beginning a new lyric-focussed miniseries, Will and Nathan take a deeper dive
into lyrics from a few songs to talk about their introspective qualities. In a
related fashion, Will and Nathan talk about how valid their own interpretations
of these lyrics are in the context of what the writers intended when penning
them. If the writer meant one thing, but we find another meaning, who's right?
Does the writer's original meaning trump ours or are our personal readings of
these lyrics just as if not more important?

[Here's the playlist of the songs we focussed on this

It's only 5 songs, but it might help find some elusive artists. _cough_ Famous
