After several technical difficulties including 2 lost recordings and 1
recording device switch, Will and Nathan finally managed to get Liza's
recording working, allowing our hosts and now regular contributor to crack on
with talking about Molchat Doma's latest album, Монумент (Monument). Molchat
Doma recently found a new burst of fame, going viral on both Russian-language
and English-language TikTok despite only making songs in Russian. Is this new
album capitalising on new fans and their wallets, is it an expression of the
'true' Molchat Doma sound or is it just a distillation of their sound to reset
and plan for the future?

We compare Molchat Doma to other contemporary cold wave artists and evaluate
how the band's releases and influences stack up against their own progenitor:
Kino. Nathan also delivers his favourite rant on album closers, highlighting
the closer to Pottery's debut album, Welcome to Bobby's Motel.

East by Silent Partner is the intro and outro track.
