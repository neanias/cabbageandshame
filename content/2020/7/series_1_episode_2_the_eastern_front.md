Joined by our friend, Liza Kupreeva, we discuss cold wave as pioneered by
Eastern European bands like Molchat Doma, Ploho and Motorama, as well as
American counterparts John Maus and Boy Harsher. We try to define what
the current cold wave scene entails, covering a bit of history on the
origins of rock behind the Iron Curtain along the way. We also take a
crack at explaining the differences are between cold wave and the
post-punk currently coming out of the UK and ask why cold wave is so
bloody popular in Latin America. (Spoiler: we still don't know.)
