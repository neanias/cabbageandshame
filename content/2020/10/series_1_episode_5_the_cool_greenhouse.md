After having said they would cover The Cool Greenhouse's album more than once
in previous episodes, Will and Nathan finally do and in a particularly rambling
session. Will admits that he probably should have cut more out of this episode
than he did (which was very little). Come listen to the hosts wax lyrical about
how much they love The Cool Greenhouse and somehow managing to not fall into
the trap of comparing them to The Fall. 

Have you listened to The Cool Greenhouse's debut self-titled album? Because you
absolutely should.
