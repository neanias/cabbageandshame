In the spirit of the spookiest of seasons, Will and Nathan assemble a list of
recent post-punk tracks that they particularly enjoy. They open with a brief
piece of post-punk Hallowe'en history with a story about one of the finest
soundtrack composers, Danny Elfman. Nathan took the editing reins this episode
and started experimenting with intro/outro tracks and some seasonal sound
effects. Do give us feedback on our Instagram page (@cabbageandshame) about it!

As mentioned in the episode, we've put the tracks we talked about and more
post-punk tracks from throughout the ages into a special Hallowe'en post-punk
playlist! Content warning: this playlist contains songs which some people may
find and disturbing. In particular Prolix contains the sounds of someone having
a panic attack. If you are prone to anxiety, you may want to remove Prolix,
Careful, and City Song from your queue. [Here's the
