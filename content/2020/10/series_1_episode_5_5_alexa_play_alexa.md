Having started talking about The Cool Greenhouse, Will and Nathan struggled so
much to stop doing so that they recorded a bonus episode _after_ the main
episode. In this bonus episode, they talk about The Cool Greenhouse's latest
single, Alexa!, as well as talking about how they got into post-punk in the
first place!
