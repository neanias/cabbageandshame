After taking a phenomenally long time to edit and release their previous
episode Will and Nathan are back, postponing their plans to talk about smaller
releases, and instead channelling their inner Anthony Fantanos to review some
of the biggest and best new releases of late 2020.

They start with IDLES' newest album, Ultra Mono, a much anticipated album
unfortunately not still named Toneland (those rubes...). Does it live up to the
hype? Do they love it, do they hate it? Come and find out!

Will and Nathan also express their opinions about Working Men's Club's
self-titled debut album which was recently released on Heavenly Recordings
after several setbacks and delays. No clickbait here! It's fantastic! Give it a
listen!

They also briefly cover Cabbage's somewhat disappointing latest album before
jumping into what may be the best EP of late 2020: Legss' latest EP,
Doomswayers.
