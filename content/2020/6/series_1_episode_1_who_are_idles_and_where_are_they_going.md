With the recent release of the single, Mr. Motivator, we delve into the musical history and
evolution of the self proclaimed "not a f\*cking punk band," IDLES. In this episode, we break down
IDLES' lyrical and musical content and try and predict where they are heading with their upcoming
third album, Toneland. Exploring past musical influences ranging from Bauhaus to LIFE, we draw
connections to similar style evolutions of Porridge Radio and Slaves. Lastly, we brave the political
quagmire of the IDLES/Sleaford Mods social media fight and talk about music, class, and
authenticity.
