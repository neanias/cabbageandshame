and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Wytr8W1WuRYBsX0Fpdljl).

This episode was recorded August 2nd before Will disappeared into the wild
reaches of northern Scotland, leaving Nathan to edit the project. Nathan's
editing skills are best described as slow, rudimentary, and yet overly
ambitious (Will sympathises). This combined with IRL events like searching for
(and finding--_sighs in relief_) gainful employment are why this episode is a
_wee bit_ late.

Nonetheless, we hope you enjoy our review of [Fontaines
D.C.'s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3SXwqSqAoBz9WCI9PDQzY6?si=66o8jgRwRIa_q9sOgu0Lrw)
second album, [A Hero's
