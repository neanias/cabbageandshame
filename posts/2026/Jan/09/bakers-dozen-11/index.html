<h1>Sorry - 925</h1>
<p>This is the album that dislodged IDLES from my top spot in 2020. In fact, my
year end top 10 albums didn&rsquo;t have any IDLES albums. The change in my top
albums from 2019 to 2020 is quite pronounced, with <em>925</em>, <em>Every Bad</em> and <em>West
of Eden</em> by HMLTD taking top billing. <em>Wide Awake!</em> was still in there at no.5,
naturally. Of the big 2019-2020 music shake up, Sorry embedded deepest into my
psyche as evidenced by the ~20 times I listened to it (digitally) that year.
Seeing Sorry play Sneaky Pete&rsquo;s about a month before they released their debut
album definitely helped cement that. (<a href="https://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/live-music/reviews/sorry-sneaky-petes-edinburgh-9-feb">That show later received a 3/5 rating in
The Skinny saying the crowd were too
sedate.</a>)</p>
<p>As lockdown bit harder and harder, I was most drawn to gloomy, guitar-driven
stuff, like <em>925</em> and <em>Every Bad</em>. What a surprise. Only after I read <em>the
book</em> did I start to really break loose and add a lot more biting late &rsquo;70s and
early &rsquo;80s post-punk. Similarly, the good weather cheered me up into albums
like <em>Twin Heavy</em> by Willie J Healey and <em>Making a New World</em> by Field Music.
Both 2 albums I really enjoy but don&rsquo;t make the Baker&rsquo;s Dozen cut.</p>
