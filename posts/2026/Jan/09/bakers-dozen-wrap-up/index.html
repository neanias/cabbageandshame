    </p>
    <p>I thought I&rsquo;d put all of the albums and write-ups in one place for easy consumption.</p>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>I get by with a little help from <del>my friends</del>
<a href="https://www.last.fm/user/SuperTweedie/library/albums">Last.FM</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a list of my favourite 13 records, I must clarify, but is more like
13 records that are particularly memorable for me. They&rsquo;re favourites of mine,
but not necessarily my favourite by a specific artist/band. I&rsquo;ll explain why
they&rsquo;re meaningful in the write-ups. The albums are largely in chronological
order for me.</p>
<p>Oddly, perhaps, neither of the eponymous bands for <em>the podcast</em> made it in.
Their albums certainly inspired and spurred both Nathan and I on in terms of our
musical discoveries, but none of them have lodged as firmly in me as these
releases.</p>
<h2>The Beatles - 1</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a cheap joke that I&rsquo;ve put 1 as the first album. But I do enjoy
it nonetheless. Anyway, I have a very clear early memory of seeing this CD being
passed into where I was sitting in the back of the car. I hold a similar memory
with Queen&rsquo;s Greatest Hits. I&rsquo;m not sure why my parents bought these specific
CDs, but they&rsquo;re now seared into my memory. The funny thing about this
compilation, I find, is that a not insignificant of The Beatles&rsquo; number 1 hits
were non-album singles — Paperback Writer being a notable one for me.</p>
<h2>ELO - Out of the Blue</h2>
<p>Wall-to-wall bangers. Mum bought a copy of this CD for the car along with the
Alan Parsons Project and one more that I can no longer remember. Maybe
<em>Breakfast in America</em> by Supertramp. This album is nothing short of lush
romanticism: the strings, the bombast, the silly &rsquo;70s English dreaming of
greater excitements than Birmingham (like being a cowboy). Jeff Lynne inherits
a lot of his string composition from the Beatles and was also, famously, a
member of the Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison. <em>Mr Blue Sky</em> was
written in Switzerland, in fact. I would say this is ELO&rsquo;s best album and I can
always return to it and be instantly put in a good mood.</p>
<h2>Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon</h2>
<p>I have had a prog phase; I know a lot music nerds who have. It feels like a
certain rite of passage in a way. As a teenager (around 14-15) I was trying to
find music to listen to of my own choosing rather than in the car and looked
through Dad&rsquo;s quite serious collection of CDs. They were largely classical, but
I remember finding this, <em>Shine on Crazy Diamond</em> and (the lesser known) <em>Atom
Heart Mother</em>. Roger and I both got really into this album and I listened to
Pink Floyd almost non-stop for about 2 months, obsessing over all the
studio-as-an-instrument detail and ignoring my parents&rsquo; suggestion to listen to
Emerson, Lake and Palmer (I had street cred, obviously).</p>
<p>I have a clear memory of trying to convince my sister of their brilliance by
pointing out their use of panning the audio from the left channel into the
right channel and then out of both ears. She just said that she’d heard other
music do that too. The copy of this that I have in my music library is probably
the same from when I ripped this CD in the kitchen in Suffolk some 15 years
ago.</p>
<p>It living on in a new iPod is a particularly fond thought.</p>
<h2>David Bowie - Hunky Dory</h2>
<p>I would have picked this regardless of the 10th anniversary series on 6Music as
it was my favourite Bowie album for a long time. I think it&rsquo;s probably since
been toppled by <em>Station to Station</em>, <em>Low</em> or perhaps <em>Scary Monsters</em>. As
many of the presenters and guests talked about, this is the album from Bowie&rsquo;s
back catalogue. His innovations and growth in song writing just before he
became wildly well-known and famous through <em>Ziggy Stardust</em>.</p>
<p>I listened to this album particularly in my gap year (again, street cred) as I
was leaving my prog rock phase and listening to other music. Bowie does, of
course, sit in a similar bracket, but this is where I started to branch out,
along with King Krule&rsquo;s first album (and King Crimson, but that&rsquo;s by the bye).
I couldn&rsquo;t quite get into <em>Ziggy</em> as much as I could <em>Hunky Dory</em>. I found
something about the experimentation of <em>Hunky Dory</em> much more exciting — it
being a bit all over the shop made it much more interesting to me. Also, it&rsquo;s
got some of Bowie&rsquo;s best songs on. I can hardly say more than Brett Anderson
has already said.</p>
<h2>Madvillain - Madvillainy</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to much hip-hop currently, but I listened to it a lot as a
teenager. My close school friend, CJ, (whom I&rsquo;m no longer in contact with 😢)
was mad about hip-hop and got me into it. We mainly listened to 2 artists
called Wax &amp; Dumbfoundead, but I can&rsquo;t say I listen to them that much these
days either.</p>
<p>As I got more and more into hip-hop, especially underground stuff, I invariably
ended up listening to MF DOOM (<em>remember all caps when you spell the man
name</em>). MF DOOM collaborated with Madlib for this release and produced an all
time record. In the same year, MF DOOM made <em>Mm..Food</em> which is a similarly
exceptional LP; there&rsquo;s some contention in the &lsquo;heads circles as to which of
the two releases is better, but this is the one that remains close to my heart.
The deeply layered rhymes and lyricism of DOOM&rsquo;s bars with the off-kilter beats
from Madlib is it for me.</p>
<h2>IDLES - Joy as an Act of Resistance</h2>
<p>IDLES get a bit of a bad rap for &hellip;many reasons, but this and <em>Brutalism</em> were
seminal albums for me. This was my stepping stone from the indie rock I&rsquo;d been
otherwise bumping to the deeper interest in post-punk and related scenes. Both
<em>Joy</em> and <em><strong>the next album in the list</strong></em> having been released in the same
year is still something quite big to me and I&rsquo;d struggle to say which was more
impactful on me at the time, even if I could tell you now which I think the
better album is.</p>
<p>This is where we transition out of school days and into university days. Nathan
and I wore this tape out when we first started listening to them; IDLES topped
my listening charts for 2 consecutive years.</p>
<h2>Parquet Courts - Wide Awake!</h2>
<p>Parquet Courts should be called <em>the</em> band of their era. The lore that they
started out as a country band before moving to become a post-punk band in
<em>&lt;Matt Berry voice&gt;New York City&lt;/Matt Berry voice&gt;</em> makes no sense, but
there&rsquo;s a certain Texas country vibe that still lurks under the surface of this
album and that really does make sense.</p>
<p>This album is all killer, no filler. The slow twisting and turning from the
hard &amp; fast opening of <em>Total Football</em> (<strong><em>AND FUCK TOM BRADY!</em></strong>), through
the unfettered anger of the delivery of <em>Violence</em> and the swan-song, murder
ballad of <em>Death Will Bring Change</em>. There&rsquo;s a certain requiem in <em>Tenderness</em>
as a closing number, but Nathan and I will continue to disagree about how
albums should be closed.</p>
<p>The lyrical content of <em>Violence</em> being largely Foucauldian in nature was a
point of recurring discussion in the flat because Nathan had been writing his
dissertation on surveillance being a form of state domestic terrorism. Also, we
were wankers.</p>
<p>This album never wilts and is, I would argue, our generation&rsquo;s <em>Entertainment!</em>.
I may have found <em>Joy</em> to have spurned me into new music, but <em>Wide Awake!</em> is
the real all-time great album.</p>
<p><em>Addendum: Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M5yqvvkjEk">this weird YouTube
video</a> where one of Anthony
Fantano&rsquo;s alter-egos interviews them and A. Savage calls him out.</em></p>
<h2>Squid - Houseplants</h2>
<p>I appreciate that this is a single and an unusual entry in this list.
<em>Houseplants</em> by Squid is the most important single in my personal musical
journey. Nathan, Jon, Jake Hoyer-Miller and I all bought tickets to go to a day
of All Points East in 2019, mainly because IDLES &amp; Run the Jewels were playing
that day. Nathan and I got to my family home in Suffolk before the others by
some hours for train ticket price reasons and started looking through the
line-up to work out who else we wanted to see <em>besides</em> IDLES &amp; RTJ. We
listened to a few singles for each band and rated them out of 10. As soon as we
heard <em>Houseplants</em>, we were in love. We were obsessed. I&rsquo;ve found the bullet
point in my notes app from 30th May 2019: <em>&ldquo;Squid - totally weird, totally
great; houseplants/10.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The reason <em>why</em> this is the most important single in my personal musical
journey is because <strong>this</strong> specific single is what got me deep into the
then-nascent post-punk scene in the UK. The number of small gigs Nathan &amp; I
went to after that shot up, the number of monthly listeners of our main bands
collapsed (rocking the &lt;1k bands) and the active trajectory of what I was
listening to changed, totally. From Squid, I got into Dry Cleaning, Sorry,
Shame, Fontaines D.C. and Lord only knows how many others. <em>Houseplants</em> was my
gateway drug and I will never kick the habit.</p>
<h2>Gang of Four - Entertainment!</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if I started listening to this album before or after I read
<em>the book</em>, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was after. (<em>Having checked Last.FM, it was
definitely after.</em>) I don&rsquo;t know how much more I can write about this album than
has already been written. It&rsquo;s a tour-de-force, it&rsquo;s vital, it&rsquo;s ever-relevant.
It&rsquo;s all true and I&rsquo;m not saying anything new.</p>
<h2>The Slits - Cut</h2>
<p>Again, what more can I write? Reading Viv Albertine&rsquo;s memoires about this time
gave me a much greater insight into its creation and the band&rsquo;s &hellip;purpose(?)
which was enriching, certainly. The <em>infamous</em> vinyl mix-up incident will never
not be funny to me, but also very joyful that you knew <em>exactly</em> which album I
would want and love.</p>
<h2>Sorry - 925</h2>
<p>This is the album that dislodged IDLES from my top spot in 2020. In fact, my
year end top 10 albums didn&rsquo;t have any IDLES albums. The change in my top
albums from 2019 to 2020 is quite pronounced, with <em>925</em>, <em>Every Bad</em> and <em>West
of Eden</em> by HMLTD taking top billing. <em>Wide Awake!</em> was still in there at no.5,
naturally. Of the big 2019-2020 music shake up, Sorry embedded deepest into my
psyche as evidenced by the ~20 times I listened to it (digitally) that year.
Seeing Sorry play Sneaky Pete&rsquo;s about a month before they released their debut
album definitely helped cement that. (<a href="https://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/live-music/reviews/sorry-sneaky-petes-edinburgh-9-feb">That show later received a 3/5 rating in
The Skinny saying the crowd were too
sedate.</a>)</p>
<p>As lockdown bit harder and harder, I was most drawn to gloomy, guitar-driven
stuff, like <em>925</em> and <em>Every Bad</em>. What a surprise. Only after I read <em>the
book</em> did I start to really break loose and add a lot more biting late &rsquo;70s and
early &rsquo;80s post-punk. Similarly, the good weather cheered me up into albums
like <em>Twin Heavy</em> by Willie J Healey and <em>Making a New World</em> by Field Music.
Both 2 albums I really enjoy but don&rsquo;t make the Baker&rsquo;s Dozen cut.</p>
<h2>The Cool Greenhouse - The Cool Greenhouse</h2>
<p>My favourite band. There&rsquo;s just something about the wry lyricism and janky,
simplistic guitars that really scratches an itch for me. I can&rsquo;t describe it in
any other way. At some point under lockdown (I think I was still living alone?)
I spent the entire evening sitting on my massive bed reading articles about The
Cool Greenhouse, mainly by <a href="https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/cool-greenhouse-crap-cardboard-pet-ep-album-review/">the
Quietus</a>,
and blasting their EPs. As you may remember, a lot of the Cabbage &amp; Shame
episode devoted to <em>The Cool Greenhouse</em> was Nathan and I just reading out the
lyrics and laughing. It was a particularly bright memory in an otherwise dull
time of my life.</p>
<p>Once the album finally came out, I listened to it over and over through the
summer, particularly in August. <em>Dirty Glasses</em> is probably my favourite track
off this LP. I know the &ldquo;dirty glasses&rdquo; refer to the morals of the noted
politicos in the song, but I prefer the idea of them actually being actual dirty
glasses as it makes the imagery a lot funnier.</p>
<p>After we recorded the episode and tagged the band on Instagram, Tom Greenhouse
replied to us about it and said they were also big fans of Yard Act and hoped to
do something with them. Alas, I think Yard Act have rather outgrown such
possibilities.</p>
<h2>Sparks - No. 1 In Heaven</h2>
<p>Would this list be complete without a Sparks album? No. Is this my 100%
favourite Sparks album? Also no. Do I have just 1 favourite Sparks album? <em>The
answer may shock you:</em> still no. The reason this is my Sparks album (<em>close rep
of &ldquo;Sparks album&rdquo;</em>) of choice here is the overwhelming flush of emotion I had
when I opened my Christmas present from you in 2023 to find it. It was only the
second time I remember where I had a real sense of astonishment when I opened
up a present. A feeling of <em>&ldquo;this is absolutely what I want and I had never
thought of it&rdquo;</em>. The warmth of being known at one&rsquo;s very core in an almost
visceral way. I was actually stunned to the point of having no words — an
unusual position for me.</p>
<p>I love this album as is, but to have had such a potent experience when given
the LP itself will elevate it into a higher personal pantheon that <em>Angst In My
Pants</em>, <em>Kimono My House</em> or <em>FFS</em> could never reach.</p>
