<h1>Squid - Houseplants</h1>
<p>I appreciate that this is a single and an unusual entry in this list.
<em>Houseplants</em> by Squid is the most important single in my personal musical
journey. Nathan, Jon, Jake Hoyer-Miller and I all bought tickets to go to a day
of All Points East in 2019, mainly because IDLES &amp; Run the Jewels were playing
that day. Nathan and I got to my family home in Suffolk before the others by
some hours for train ticket price reasons and started looking through the
line-up to work out who else we wanted to see <em>besides</em> IDLES &amp; RTJ. We
listened to a few singles for each band and rated them out of 10. As soon as we
heard <em>Houseplants</em>, we were in love. We were obsessed. I&rsquo;ve found the bullet
point in my notes app from 30th May 2019: <em>&ldquo;Squid - totally weird, totally
great; houseplants/10.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The reason <em>why</em> this is the most important single in my personal musical
journey is because <strong>this</strong> specific single is what got me deep into the
then-nascent post-punk scene in the UK. The number of small gigs Nathan &amp; I
went to after that shot up, the number of monthly listeners of our main bands
collapsed (rocking the &lt;1k bands) and the active trajectory of what I was
listening to changed, totally. From Squid, I got into Dry Cleaning, Sorry,
Shame, Fontaines D.C. and Lord only knows how many others. <em>Houseplants</em> was my
gateway drug and I will never kick the habit.</p>
