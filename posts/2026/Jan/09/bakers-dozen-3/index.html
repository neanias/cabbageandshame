<h1>Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon</h1>
<p>I have had a prog phase; I know a lot music nerds who have. It feels like a
certain rite of passage in a way. As a teenager (around 14-15) I was trying to
find music to listen to of my own doing rather than in the car and looked
through Dad’s quite serious collection of CDs. They were largely classical, but
I remember finding this, <em>Shine on Crazy Diamond</em> and (the lesser known) <em>Atom
Heart Mother</em>. Roger and I both got really into this album and I listened to
Pink Floyd almost non-stop for about 2 months, obsessing over all the
studio-as-an-instrument detail and ignoring my parent’s suggestion to listen to
Emerson, Lake and Palmer (I had street cred, obviously).</p>
<p>I have a clear memory of trying to convince my sister of their brilliance by
pointing out their use of panning the audio from the left channel into the
right channel and then out of both ears. She just said that she’d heard other
music do that too. The copy of this that I have in my music library is probably
the same from when I ripped this CD in the kitchen in Suffolk some 15 years
ago.</p>
<p>It living on in a new iPod is a particularly fond thought.</p>
